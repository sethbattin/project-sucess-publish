Project Success Website Demo
============================

This [Git repo](what-is-git) is an example project for publishing your website work.  You can use this to put HTML projects on the public internet.  It uses [Heroku](heroku) to publish files for no cost.

Getting Started
---------------
This project is almost the same as [Heroku's getting started guide](installing), so read it for all the details.  There is one exception: when you get to "Prepare the app", use these commands instead
```sh
git clone https://github.com/sethbattin/project-success-publish.git
cd project-success-publish
```

Adding your files
-----------------
You can add your own files inside the folder called `content`.  Anything you add there will be available publicly by the same name.

Progamming pages
----------------
You can also program your website to do whatever you want.  This project uses [ExpressJS](expressjs) as server, and you can read all about it at [https://expressjs.com](expressjs).
